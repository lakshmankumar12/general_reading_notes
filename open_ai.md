# L2 guidelines

* Prompting Principles
    * Principle 1: Write clear and specific instructions
        * clear need not necessarily be short
    * Principle 2: Give the model time to “think”
* Tactics
    * Use delimiters to clearly indicate distinct parts of the input
        * Delimiters can be anything like: ` ```, """, < >, <tag> </tag>, :`
