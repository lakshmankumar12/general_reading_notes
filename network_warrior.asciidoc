Notes from reading Network Warrior
==================================

Diff between Hub and Router
---------------------------

* Hub simply replicates everything on all ports
* Switch learns which port has which mac. This is typically on a CAM.
* Hubs can easily cause loops - making collision detect messy. Switches dont suffer

AutoNegotiation
---------------

* Negotiates both Speed and Duplex mode
* (My thinking:) Too low level stuff, move on


VLAN
----

* Origianl VLAN simply represents grouping physical ports at switches w/o any knowledge to end machines, that still send normal ethernet pkts
* Trunk is a special port which carries pkts from all VLANs from one switch to another. The pkts in this trunk are encapsulated in a ISL protocol header.
* 802.1Q is a newer introduction, where end uses themeselves tag their pkts.
