## Part II

### Rule-1 - Work Deeply

* Depth Philosophy
    * Monastic -> months on in deep
    * Bimodal  -> few days on in deep
    * Rhythmic -> few hours on in deep
    * Journalistic -> blocks in deep
* Ritualize
    * Where you will work and how long
    * How you will work
        * any rules or rituals - eg: no outlook opened/browser opened.
    * How will you support your work
        * have a cup of coffee before i start
* Make Grand Gestures
    * Go to a separate work-room etc..
* Don't Work Alone
    * If needed seek help/collaborate - but in a deep way, WHEN appropriate
* Execute Like a Business
    * Focus on the Wildly Important
    * Act on the Lead Measure
        * lead - that you can measure while you work
        * lag - that you measure after results are produced.
    * Keep a compelling scoreboard
    * Create a cadence of Accountability
* Be Lazy
    » relax?
    * Downtime aids insights
    * Downtime helps recharge the energy needed to work deeply
    * The work that you do in your downtime is usually not that important


### Rule-2 Embrace Boredom

* Don't take breaks from boredom instead from focus
    » Basically, you assume your natural state is focus, and then
      plan when you will take breaks for non-deep activity instead
      of planning when you do focus-activity
    * Works, even if your work demands lots of internet use/email replies
    * You must keep time outside of the block absolutely free of internet use
    * Schedule explicitly internet times at work, in addition to office
        * And of course no internet outside of that UNLESS emergency
* Work like Teddy Roosevelt
    * Stretch your deep muscles when you are at focus-times
* Meditate Productively
    » Like mindfulness meditation - gently bring your mind back to your work.
    * Be wary of distractions and looping
        * your mind may grind already known stuff over and over.
    * Structure your deep thinking
* Memorize a deck of cards
    * Or any other activity that works your mind muscles.

### Rule-3 Quit Social Media
