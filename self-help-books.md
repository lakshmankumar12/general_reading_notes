## Part II

### Rule-1 - Work Deeply

    * Monastic -> months on in deep
    * Bimodal  -> few days on in deep
    * Rhythmic -> few hours on in deep
    * Journalistic -> blocks in deep
* Ritualize
    * Where you will work and how long
    * How you will work
        * any rules or rituals - eg: no outlook opened/browser opened.

        * lag - that you measure after results are produced.
    * Keep a compelling scoreboard
    * Create a cadence of Accountability
* Be Lazy
    » relax?
    * Downtime aids insights
    * Downtime helps recharge the energy needed to work deeply
    * The work that you do in your downtime is usually not that important


### Rule-2 Embrace Boredom

* Don't take breaks from boredom instead from focus
    » Basically, you assume your natural state is focus, and then
      plan when you will take breaks for non-deep activity instead
      of planning when you do focus-activity
    * Works, even if your work demands lots of internet use/email replies
    * You must keep time outside of the block absolutely free of internet use
    * Schedule explicitly internet times at work, in addition to office
        * And of course no internet outside of that UNLESS emergency
* Work like Teddy Roosevelt
    * Stretch your deep muscles when you are at focus-times
* Meditate Productively
    » Like mindfulness meditation - gently bring your mind back to your work.
    * Be wary of distractions and looping
        * your mind may grind already known stuff over and over.
    * Structure your deep thinking
* Memorize a deck of cards
    * Or any other activity that works your mind muscles.

### Rule-3 Quit Social Media

* Any-benefit approach to tools selection is flawed
* Use the craftsman approach to tools selection
* Apply the law of vital few to your internet habits
    * Have your list of personal goals
    * Only orient your internet usage around your personal goals
* Law of Vital Few - 80/20
* Quit for a month
* Dont use internet as entertainment


### Rule-4 Drain the shallow

* Be very picky of which shallow work you will do.
    * They can easily eat into your time.
* Schedule every minute of your day
* Quantify the depth of each activity
    * How long it would take for a fresh college grad to train
      to do this in month.
        `< 3` months - Shallow.
* Ask your boss for a shallow work budget
* Finish your work by five-thirty
* Become hard to reach
    * Make people who send email to you do more work.
    * Do more work when you send email or reply to email
* Dont respond to email if it doesn't matter
    * ambiguous or hard to give a reasonable response
    * not a question/proposal that interests you
    * no good/bad would happen by responding

# Great At Work - Morten T Hansen

* There are 7 principles - 4 for mastering your own work, and 3 for mastering working with groups

## Principle 1 : Do Less and then Obsess

* Choosing to focus on a self few is only half the problem.
  The next harsh requirement is to obsess on the one you
  have chosen to focus
* 3 strategies
    * Wield the Razor : As few as you can, as many as you must.
        * Shave off as much as you can
    * Tie yourself to the Mast : Plan to not have distractions
    * Say no to your boss
        * Explain that you can't de-focus.
        * Set clear priorities with your boss

### when you shouldn't focus to a few

* When you want to generate more ideas
* When you are not sure what to focus on

## Principle 2 : Redesign your work

* Understand value
    * outside-in view - how it benefits others
    * inside-out view - internal metrics
* Productivity = output-of-work / time-spent (not a great metric)
* ValueOfWork = benefitToOthers * quality * efficiency
    * All 3 are needed. Any one is zero makes value 0
* Note that beyond 50 hours of work a week, your output will tank out.
  No point in squeezing the orange beyond this
* To create value
    * Less Fluff - Remove non-essential items out of work
    * More Right Stuff - Increase high-value activities
    * More Gee Whiz - Create new activities
    * Improve quality of existing stuff
    * Faster, Cheaper - Do high value activities faster and efficiently
* How to redesign
    * Identify pain points

Problem:
    * New demands - but finite resources
    * Our jobs and live keep changin
Promise:
    * Ready state of martial art - mind like water
    * Can you get into that state?
Principle : Dealing effectively with internal commitments
    1. If its on your mind, your mind isn't clear. Capture it in a trusted system
    2. Clarify what exactly is your commitment. Decide what you have to do to
        fulfill it.

        review regularly

# Atomic Habits

## The fundamentals

Chapter 1: The surprising power of atomic habits

* Habits are the compound interest, of self-improvement. Getting one-percent
  better everyday counts for a lot in the long run
* Habits are a double edged sword. They can work for you, or against you,
  which is why understanding the details is essential.
* Small changes often appear to make no difference, until you cross a critical
  threshold. The most powerful outcomes of any compounding processes are
  delayed. You need to be patient.
* An atomic habit is a little habit that is part of a larger system. Just as
  atom are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are the building
  blocks of remarkable results.
* If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your
  systems instead.
* You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your
  systems.

Chapter 2: How your habits shape your Identity

* There are 3 levels of change:
    * outcome change,
    * process change, and
    * identity change.
* The most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on what you
  want to achieve, but on who you wish to become.
* Your identity emerges out of your habits. Every action is a vote for a type
  of person you wish to become.
* Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your
  beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.
* The real reason habits matter is not because they can get you better results
  (although they can do that),but because they can change your beliefs about
  yourself.

Chapter 3: How to build better habits in 4 steps

* A habit is a behaviour that has been enough times to become automatic.
* The ultimate purpose of habits is to solve the problems of life with as
  little energy and effort as possible.
* Any habit can be broken down into a feedback loop that involves 4 steps:
    * cue, craving, response, and reward.
* The 4 laws of behaviour change are a simple set of rules that we can use to
  build better habits. They are
    1. Make it obvious,
    2. Make it attractive,
    3. Make it easy,
    4. Make it satisfying.

## First Law

Chapter 4: Awareness of habits

* With enough practice, your brain will pick up on the cues that predict
  certain outcomes without consciously thinking about it.
* Once our habits become automatic, we stop paying attention to what we are
  doing.
* The process of behaviour change always starts with awareness. You need to be
  aware of your habits before you can change them.
* Pointing and calling raises your level of awareness from a non-conscious
  habit to a more concious level by verbalizing your actions.
* The habits scorecard is a simple exercise you can use to become more aware
  of your behaviour.

Chapter 5: Best way to start a new habit

* The first law of behaviour change is to make it obvious.
* The 2 most common cues are time and location.
* Creating an IMPLEMENTATION INTENTION is a strategy you can use to pair a
  new habit with a specific time and location.
* The implementation intention formula is:
    * I will [Behaviour] at [Time] in [Location].
* Habit stacking is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a current
  habit
* The habit stacking formula is:
    * After [Current Habit], I will [New Habit].
