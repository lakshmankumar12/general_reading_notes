# Deep Work - Cal Newport

## Part I

### Deep Work is Rewarding

* If you practise it, you will be the star at work - and be paid better/retained/sought after

### Deep Work is Rare

### Deep Work is Meaningful

* It is philosophically enriching.

## Part II

### Rule-1 - Work Deeply

* Depth Philosophy
    * Monastic -> months on in deep
    * Bimodal  -> few days on in deep
    * Rhythmic -> few hours on in deep
    * Journalistic -> blocks in deep
* Ritualize
    * Where you will work and how long
    * How you will work
        * any rules or rituals - eg: no outlook opened/browser opened.
    * How will you support your work
        * have a cup of coffee before i start
* Make Grand Gestures
    * Go to a separate work-room etc..
* Don't Work Alone
    * If needed seek help/collaborate - but in a deep way, WHEN appropriate
* Execute Like a Business
    * Focus on the Wildly Important
    * Act on the Lead Measure
        * lead - that you can measure while you work
        * lag - that you measure after results are produced.
    * Keep a compelling scoreboard
    * Create a cadence of Accountability
* Be Lazy
    » relax?
    * Downtime aids insights
    * Downtime helps recharge the energy needed to work deeply
    * The work that you do in your downtime is usually not that important


### Rule-2 Embrace Boredom

* Don't take breaks from boredom instead from focus
    » Basically, you assume your natural state is focus, and then
      plan when you will take breaks for non-deep activity instead
      of planning when you do focus-activity
    * Works, even if your work demands lots of internet use/email replies
    * You must keep time outside of the block absolutely free of internet use
    * Schedule explicitly internet times at work, in addition to office
        * And of course no internet outside of that UNLESS emergency
* Work like Teddy Roosevelt
    * Stretch your deep muscles when you are at focus-times
* Meditate Productively
    » Like mindfulness meditation - gently bring your mind back to your work.
    * Be wary of distractions and looping
        * your mind may grind already known stuff over and over.
    * Structure your deep thinking
* Memorize a deck of cards
    * Or any other activity that works your mind muscles.

### Rule-3 Quit Social Media

* Any-benefit approach to tools selection is flawed
* Use the craftsman approach to tools selection
* Apply the law of vital few to your internet habits
    * Have your list of personal goals
    * Only orient your internet usage around your personal goals
* Law of Vital Few - 80/20
* Quit for a month
* Dont use internet as entertainment


### Rule-4 Drain the shallow

* Be very picky of which shallow work you will do.
    * They can easily eat into your time.
* Schedule every minute of your day
* Quantify the depth of each activity
    * How long it would take for a fresh college grad to train
      to do this in month.
        `< 3` months - Shallow.
* Ask your boss for a shallow work budget
* Finish your work by five-thirty
* Become hard to reach
    * Make people who send email to you do more work.
    * Do more work when you send email or reply to email
* Dont respond to email if it doesn't matter
    * ambiguous or hard to give a reasonable response
    * not a question/proposal that interests you
    * no good/bad would happen by responding

# Great At Work - Morten T Hansen

* There are 7 principles - 4 for mastering your own work, and 3 for mastering working with groups

## Principle 1 : Do Less and then Obsess

* Choosing to focus on a self few is only half the problem.
  The next harsh requirement is to obsess on the one you
  have chosen to focus
* 3 strategies
    * Wield the Razor : As few as you can, as many as you must.
        * Shave off as much as you can
    * Tie yourself to the Mast : Plan to not have distractions
    * Say no to your boss
        * Explain that you can't de-focus.
        * Set clear priorities with your boss

### when you shouldn't focus to a few

* When you want to generate more ideas
* When you are not sure what to focus on

## Principle 2 : Redesign your work

* Understand value
    * outside-in view - how it benefits others
    * inside-out view - internal metrics
* Productivity = output-of-work / time-spent (not a great metric)
* ValueOfWork = benefitToOthers * quality * efficiency
    * All 3 are needed. Any one is zero makes value 0
* Note that beyond 50 hours of work a week, your output will tank out.
  No point in squeezing the orange beyond this
* To create value
    * Less Fluff - Remove non-essential items out of work
    * More Right Stuff - Increase high-value activities
    * More Gee Whiz - Create new activities
    * Improve quality of existing stuff
    * Faster, Cheaper - Do high value activities faster and efficiently
* How to redesign
    * Identify pain points
