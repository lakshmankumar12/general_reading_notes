Notes from 29.274
=================

Well Defined ports
------------------

* Control port is 2123
* Data port is 2152
* V0-used 3386. GTPP' uses 3386

Teid Components
---------------

* Interface-Type, TEID, IPv4 address and/or IPv6 address
* one IP is mandatory. Both may be present.
* port is not there. So, you can't demux by port. (But you have a free run to choose local-port if you are initiating the message)

TEID is commucated in
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* "Sender F-TEID for Control Plane" IE,
* "PGW S5/S8/S2a/S2b F-TEID for PMIP based interface or for GTP based Control Plane interface" IE,
* "MSC Server Sv TEID for Control Plane" IE,
* "S3/S16/S10 Address and TEID for Control Plane" IE, or
* "MME/SGSN Sv TEID for Control Plane" IE.

Teid-uniqueness on various interfaces
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* PGW-side of things:  One TEID for one PDN-session
** S5, S8, S2a, S2b
* SGSN/MME side of things: One TEID per UE
** S3, S10, S16, S11

Headers
---------

V1:

Version | PT | spare | E| S| PN
Type
Len (2 Octet)
Teid (4 Octet)
Seq Num (if S bit, 2 Octet)
N-Pdu (if PN bit, 1 octet)
Next Hdr Type (if E bit)

V2:

Version | P | T | spare
MessageType
Len (2 Octet)
Teid (if T, 4 octets)
Seq Num (2 Octet)

P - Piggybacked message present (Create-Bearer-Req piggybacked on Create-Session-Resp)
T - Triggered response


V1-headers
----------

Len, Type, content.

The first 2 bits tell if comprehension is reqd by intermediary/end-point node.

As of now, there are suspend req/rsp, pdcp pdu num, msinfo change reporting indication, mbms support ind


General notes
--------------

* MABR can be sent from MME to SGW, when MME thinks, its just a change of S1-U values and no need to inform PGW.
  SGW can accept this or can ask the MME to re-do a MBR.

The 3 major handovers
-----------------------

X2 Handover
~~~~~~~~~~~

* MME doesn't change. SGW may change or not change.
* X2 reference point is necessary.
* If no-sgw change, SGW receives a MABR or MBR. Signalling to PGW is
  typically not needed. (Unless required for other reasons like ULI)
* If sgw change, receives a CS-Req with S1-U Teid. MBR is sent right away to PGW
** In this case, its assumed tgt-enb can contact src-Sgw. If not S1-HO
   is required

S1 Handover
~~~~~~~~~~~

* MME and SGW may change.
* Sgw receives a CS-Req without S1-U Teid. No MBR yet to PGW.
* Sgw waits for MB-Req later, at which point, it sends MBR to PGW

Idle-mode TAU
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Sgw receives a CS-Req without S1-U Teid. MBR sent right away to PGW.
