Well Defined ports
------------------

* Control port is 2123

Teid Components
---------------

* Interface-Type, TEID, IPv4 address and/or IPv6 address
* one IP is mandatory. Both may be present.
* port is not there. So, you can't demux by port. (But you have a free run to choose local-port if you are initiating the message)

Teid-uniqueness on various interfaces
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* PGW-side of things:  One TEID for one PDN-session
** S5, S8, S2a, S2b
* SGSN/MME side of things: One TEID per UE
** S3, S10, S16
