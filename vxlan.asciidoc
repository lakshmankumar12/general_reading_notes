VXLAN notes
===========

What it tries to do
-------------------

VXLAN is an L2 overlay over an L3 network. That is, it emulates a BiiiG
L2 Network across a L3 network. Like, one BiiG L2 network over data-centers
spread across say SFO and Boston.

Terminologies/Concepts
----------------------

VXLAN Segment:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each overlay network(L2 network, that is being spread out) is known as a VXLAN
Segment and identified by a unique 24-bit segment ID called a VXLAN Network
Identifier (VNI).

Only virtual machine on the same VNI are allowed to communicate with each
other.  Virtual machines are identified uniquely by the combination of their
MAC addresses and VNI.  As such it is possible to have duplicate MAC addresses
in different VXLAN Segments without issue, but not in the same VXLAN Segments.

VXLAN Tunnel End Points (VTEP)

The Host machine that will process the VxLAN pkt and strip off VXLAN info and present the actual
inner pkt to its guests

VTEP Discovery
---------------

If this is not known, as in the case of a target virtual machine that the VTEP
has not targeted before,  a discovery process needs to be done by originating
VTEP.  This is done in a couple of steps:

* Destination IP is replaced with the IP multicast group corresponding to the
  VNI of the originating virtual machine
* All VTEPs that have subscribed to the IP multicast group receive the frame
  and decapsulate it learning the mapping of source virtual machine MAC address
  and host VTEP
* The host VTEP of the destination virtual machine will then send the virtual
  machines response to the originating VTEP using its destination IP address as
  it learned this from the original multicast frame
* The Source VTEP adds the new mapping of VTEP to virtual machine MAC address
  to its tables for future packets

(Nothing very magical here!)
