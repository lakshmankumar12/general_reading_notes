VXLAN notes
===========

What it tries to do
-------------------

VXLAN is an L2 overlay over an L3 network. That is, it emulates a BiiiG
L2 Network across a L3 network. Like, one BiiG L2 network over data-centers
spread across say SFO and Boston.

Terminologies/Concepts
----------------------

VXLAN Segment:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each overlay network(L2 network, that is being spread out) is known as a VXLAN
Segment and identified by a unique 24-bit segment ID called a VXLAN Network
Identifier (VNI).

Only virtual machine on the same VNI are allowed to communicate with each
other.  Virtual machines are identified uniquely by the combination of their
MAC addresses and VNI.  As such it is possible to have duplicate MAC addresses
in different VXLAN Segments without issue, but not in the same VXLAN Segments.

VXLAN Tunnel End Points (VTEP)

The Host machine that will process the VxLAN pkt and strip off VXLAN info and present the actual
inner pkt to its guests

VTEP Discovery
---------------

If this is not known, as in the case of a target virtual machine that the VTEP
has not targeted before,  a discovery process needs to be done by originating
VTEP.  This is done in a couple of steps:
